#  GMU CS633 Programming Assignment 01: Rotating Caliper for Computing the Bounding Boxes

Goals: 
1. Implement convex hull algorithm, "On-line construction of the convex hull of a simple polygon", by A. Melkman.
   - You can find a short introduction of the paper and code here: http://geomalgorithms.com/a12-_hull-3.html
   - Understand the paepr and code, and re-implement it using the provided frameowrk
  
2. Implement the rotating calipers algorithm to compute the smallest bounding boxes of a polygon
   - Use the convex hull build from Step#1, compute the smallest bounding boxes
   - Rotating calipers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_calipers
